# Stock Hawk

How Will I Complete this Project?
You will improve the Stock Hawk app for this project.

You can download the starting code for Stock Hawk from the Stock Hawk repository on GitHub. The app currently finds stock prices from the internet and allows users to add stocks to track.

Your job will be to take the user feedback in the UX Review and implement changes that will make the app production ready.

All of the issues you need to address to meet specifications are hinted at in the UX Review. There are also a few optional ways in which the apps can be improved that are not mentioned in the UX Review.

Supporting Courses
You should have the skills you need to complete this app after completing Developing Android Apps and Advanced Android App Development.

Required Tasks
Download the app code from the Stock Hawk repository on GitHub.
Read the UX Review in the next node.
Spend time exploring the current state of the app, looking for ways they could be improved. Be sure to look specifically at issues called out in the UX Review.
Execute the improvements!
Note about google-services.json - To avoid seeing the error "GoogleService failed to initialize, status: 10" you should create a google-services.json file. You can generate one here. This file should not be included in your submission.

User Feedback for Stock Hawk:
Hellen says:
"Right now I can't use this app with my screen reader. My friends love it, so I would love to download it, but the buttons don't tell my screen reader what they do."

Your boss says:
"We need to prepare Stock Hawk for the Egypt release. Make sure our translators know what to change and make sure the Arabic script will format nicely."

Adebowale says:
"Stock Hawk allows me to track the current price of stocks, but to track their prices over time, I need to use an external program. It would be wonderful if you could show more detail on a stock, including its price over time."

Gundega says:
"I use a lot of widgets on my Android device, and I would love to have a widget that displays my stock quotes on my home screen."

Jamal says:
"I found a bug in your app. Right now when I search for a stock quote that doesn't exist, the app crashes."

Xaio-lu says:
"When I opened this app for the first time without a network connection, it was a confusing blank screen. I would love a message that tells me why the screen is blank or whether my stock quotes are out of date."
